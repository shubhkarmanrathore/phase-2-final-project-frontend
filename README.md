## Features
- This is a CRUD application.

### NOTE : The deployed backend instance requires a spin-up after the instance has been inactive for a while. (This is just a part of the free tier by render.com) It is necessary for all the CRUD functionality to work. This is my backend deployed link https://json-server-2-i5l2.onrender.com/blogs that you might need to open it once before using the website.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, and ReactJS were used to create the UI.
